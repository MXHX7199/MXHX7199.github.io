Fangxin (Leon) Liu is an Assistant Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), specializing in neural network acceleration (e.g., neural network compression and SW/HW co-design.), in-memory computing, and brain-inspired neuromorphic computing.

He obtained his Ph.D. Degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Li Jiang. 
<!-- You can find more information about Prof. Jiang [here](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli//). -->

The papers and related resources will be shared on my [Github](https://github.com/MXHX7199) in the near future.
